### CPSC 120

* Lab 8

    Lab 8, part 3 was one of my favorites because I got to make an ASCII art animation. I had always known of the art style but what blew my mind about it was when the art moved around because of the code that I written.

* Lab 9

   Lab 9, part 2 was another one of my favorites because I never knew how auto-correct worked. Despite my dislike for autocorrect on phones autocorrect is useful for me when writing papers on computers. This lab made me think on how Samsung phones incorporate drag typing and is probably a similar process.

* Lab 10

    Lab 10, part 3 was my most favorite because I got to make colorful pictures. I made a mistake with the ratios and the output was an interesting gradient that caught my eye. The gradient also caught the eye of some of my friends and peers. I plan on using the gradient for one of my friends who requested for a thumbnail of that gradient for their youtube channel.
